# ü•ó WAPI

Cloned from [WAPI](https://github.com/yohanesgultom/wapi)

Thanks to [Yohanes Gultom](https://github.com/yohanesgultom) AND [whatsapp-web.js TEAM](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js)

Simple REST API wrapper for the super awesome [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the nature of the `whatsapp-web.js` dependency on WhatsApp Web behaviours, regular maintainance is required (library update, temporary workaround). If you face any unknown issue that is not fixed in this wrapper, consider checking [whatsapp-web.js issue page](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/issues)

support of [google-libphonenumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-libphonenumber) is added and some minor changes.

docker removed

[issue resolved](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/issues/2861)
